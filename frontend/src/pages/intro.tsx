      When we talk about music, we're speaking of an art form that dances on the
      spectrum of sound, a realm where noise and melody coalesce and diverge in
      a complex ballet of frequencies. Our research delves into the intricate
      patterns that emerge when we dissect music to its core, discerning the
      fine line where music ceases to be noise and transforms into an organized
      symphony of sound that can convey a spectrum of emotions and instructions.
      <br />
      At the heart of our inquiry lies three pivotal tasks:
      <ol>
        <li>the differentiation between music and noise</li>
        <li>
          the classification of music based on valence and arousal (the
          emotional content and energy it conveys)
        </li>
        <li>the instructional capacity of instrumental music.</li>
      </ol>
      These tasks help us to unravel the threads that compose the rich tapestry
      of music. Let us tune our instruments and prepare to delve into the
      symphony of sounds, to distinguish the noise from the music, and to
      discover the patterns that lie within.

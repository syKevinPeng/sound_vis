        The quest to delineate music from noise is a fascinating study of sound
        and its perception. Our research endeavors to pinpoint the defining
        characteristics that separate the order and harmony of music from the
        perceived disorder of noise. This examination is rooted in the physics
        of sound waves and extends to the complex realms of auditory perception
        and cultural interpretation.

        Music is traditionally understood as a deliberate arrangement of sounds,
        marked by rhythm, melody, and harmony, intentionally composed to convey
        emotion and aesthetic pleasure. Noise, conversely, is often
        characterized as sound without deliberate structure, sometimes erratic
        and undesired, generally lacking the intentionality and organization
        inherent in music.

        Yet, the demarcation between music and noise is not absolute; it is
        influenced by individual and cultural subjectivities. The patter of rain
        may be intrusive to some, yet soothing to others. Our research focuses
        on the objective qualities of these auditory phenomena, exploring their
        acoustic properties in an effort to classify and understand them within
        a scientific and cultural framework. Through this investigation, we aim
        to refine our understanding of sound patterns, enhancing our ability to
        discern the complex structure using various visualization techniques.
